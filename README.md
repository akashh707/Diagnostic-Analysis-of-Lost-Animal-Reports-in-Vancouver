Project Title:
Diagnostic Analysis of Lost Animal Reports in Vancouver

Objective:
The goal of this project is to conduct a diagnostic analysis of lost animal reports in Vancouver using cloud-based tools and datasets. The analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and underlying causes for the lost animal cases between 2023 and 2024. By leveraging cloud computing and data analysis techniques, this project will uncover actionable insights that can improve animal recovery and community safety efforts.

Background:
Over the past two years, the city of Vancouver has experienced a notable number of missing animal reports. Local authorities and animal shelters are seeking to understand the patterns and factors contributing to these cases. This analysis will help authorities and policymakers devise better strategies for animal management and recovery.
